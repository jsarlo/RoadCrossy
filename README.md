# RoadCrossy

ABOUT: 

Road Crossy is a road crossing game where the user attempts to pass each lane of the road without being hit by a car. I created this as part of javascript class that I took. It uses the three.js and tween.js libraries to bring the world to life. It greatly improved my understanding of javascript and it was fun to learn about the three.js and tween.js libaries.

The user utilies the ARROW PAD to move the player object (a cow) throughout the world. The goal of the game is to cross as many sections of the road and grass as you can to get the highest score. For each section that is passed, the users score is increased by one.
